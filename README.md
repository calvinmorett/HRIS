# HRIS
Google has removed some functionality for image searches, specifically searching 2 and 4 mega pixels. This extension will bring back this key functionality.

----
**Setup Instructions:**
- To install, enable developer mode in Chrome, by typing `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar.
- The top right of this page will include a toggle for developer mode, toggle it on now, and you will see more options appear on the left hand side.
- One of those options is *Load unpacked,* click this and navigate to the **HRIS** folder and select it.
- The extention should be added to your list of extensions on the page, as well as the **HRIS** icon will appear at the top right with other extension icons.

**Using the extension:**
- Once you've successfully added the extension through developer mode, you can use the extension.
- To use the extension go to Google, and search. Click Images to change the search to find images.
- Then click the extension icon and wait for the page to reload.
- The page should have added part of Googles API in the URL and reloaded the page, and the results should show up as high resolution, large dimension images.

----
Click the extension icon while actively searching for Google Images, to show bigger sizes, if they're available.
